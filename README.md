# YASL
Bytecode Interpreter for Yet Another Scripting Language (YASL). More information can be found on my site, here: https://coffeetableespresso.github.io/yasl.

## Building Interpreter
The interpreter can be compiled using the Makefile via the command `make`.
The environment can be cleaned of all binaries (object files and YASL) with `make clean`.
